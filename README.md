Demo submission. 

This demo only uses Dotween package as it is most commonly used in game dev. Rest is all completed with the standard unity tools. 

Some things to note for this game. 

Game Settings scriptable object:

Game settings is located in “Assets/Scriptable Objects” here we can do the following 
1. tweak some of the tween values used by the cards
2. Set the score per correct match
3. Finally, you can reset the score by right click on it and selecting Reset Score.

Sound Collection scriptable object:

Sound collection can be used to assign all the audio clips that are used as well their correct volume.

Sprite Collection scriptable object:

This Scriptable object is used to generate Random matching images in each level, so it is easier to simply change the images and the whole system will work just fine.
